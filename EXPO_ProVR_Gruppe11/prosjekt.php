		<p>
		ProVR aims to solve the issues related to professional collaborations performed both in person and through various digital meeting platforms, by allowing product engineers to collaborate with their colleagues in private virtual reality environments, where their work can be shown. In this environment, the participants will be able to interact with CAD models, while also being able to see each other in the form of humanlike avatars.
